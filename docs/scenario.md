### Background Story

_In the year 2044, following the great water conflicts of 2033, humankind has finally colonized and terraformed Mars; so much in fact that it greatly (structurally) resembles parts of old Earth. Unfortunately, scientists are still working on making the atmosphere breathable, so humans still need (costly) special equipment to leave their homes. Luckily, some entrepreneurial individuals found remnants of the old 'All Terrain Planetary Vehicles' which they retrofitted to do some serious business. Wanting to improve life for everyone on Mars (and to make a living off of that), they are sending their ATPVs out to gather the planet's natural resources and supply everyone in need with useful items._

### Introduction

The scenario consists of two __teams__ of a number of agents each moving through the streets of a realistic city. The goal for each team is to earn as much money as possible, which is rewarded for completing certain __jobs__. An agent is characterized by its __battery__ (i.e. how long it can move without recharging), its __capacity__ (i.e. how much volume it can carry) and its __speed__. The scenario features 4 distinct __roles__: drones, motorcycles, cars and trucks, sorted by increasing capacity and energy, and decreasing speed.
The city map is taken from __OpenStreetMap__ data and routing is provided by the Contest server. As the simulation is divided into discrete steps, each agent can move a fixed distance each turn (unless its destination is closer than this distance).

Each simulation features a set of random __items__. Items differ by their volume and how they can be acquired.

The agents are positioned randomly on the map, as are a number of __facilities__, among them __shops__, __charging stations__, __workshops__, __resource nodes__, __storage__ facilities, and __dumps__.

__Jobs__ comprise the acquisition, assembling, and transportation of goods. These jobs can be created by either the system (environment) or one of the agent teams. There are two types of jobs: __regular jobs__ and __auctions__.

A team can accept an __auction__ job by bidding on it. The bid will be the reward, i.e. the team is willing to procure the items for that amount of money. Thus, if both teams bid, the lowest bid wins. If a job is not completed in time, the corresponding team is fined to discourage auction “hoarding”.

__Regular jobs__ have their rewards defined upfront, which is given to the first team to complete that job, while the other team goes away empty-handed. The teams have to decide which jobs to complete and how to do that.
While auction jobs have to be more thoroughly assessed in order to determine a minimum threshold at which the team would still earn money, they provide some safety since the team that did not win the auction is effectively barred from completing it.

__Tournament points__ are distributed according to the amount of money a team owns at the end of the simulation. To get the most points, a team has to beat the other, as well as surpass the seed capital given to the team at the beginning of the simulation, i.e. make an overall profit.

## Locations

Locations in the scenario are given as pairs of latitude and longitude double values. For the sake of simplicity, we assume them to form a uniform grid (which will be okay, if we don't go near the poles).

To simplify reaching a location, these values are rounded and approximated with the help of two parameters:

__Proximity:__ The proximity value specifies which precise locations are still considered the same, which is important when an agent needs to be at the same location as e.g. another agent or a facility.
So, it determines how many decimal places of the latitude and longitude values are compared when checking equality of Locations.

_Example:_ 51.1111 and 51.1112 would still be considered equal with a proximity of 3 and different with a proximity of 4.

__CellSize:__ The cell size specifies the length in meters an agent with speed 1 could travel in a single step.

## Items

Each simulation features a (random) set of item types. Items have a unique __name__ and a __volume__, which comes into play when items must be carried or stored.

Also, many items need to be _assembled_ from other items. Each of those
items has a number of __requirements__, i.e. quantities of other items which need to be present to assemble the item. These items are consumed during the process. Also, some items require certain tools.

### Tools

Tools are special types of items.
* They never need to be assembled but are requried to assemble other items.
* Each tool is only usable by a subset of all agent roles.
* Assembly requires at most 1 of any tool type (but possibly multiple types).
* Tools are not destroyed/consumed during assembly.

## Facilities

Facilities are placed randomly on the map. Each facility has a unique name and location.

#### Shops

In __shops__, items can be bought at prices specific to the particular shop. Each shop only offers limited quantities of a subset of all items. However, items are restocked after a number of steps.

E.g. if a shop has __restock__ 5, one piece of each missing item is added to the shop's stock each 5 steps.

#### Charging stations

__Charging stations__ have to be frequently visited by agents in order to recharge their battery. They have a __rate__ which expresses the amount of charge that
can be restored in one step (i.e. a charging station with a rate of 40 would
restore 40 charge units of an agent's battery).

#### Workshops

In __workshops__, agents can assemble items out of other required items. Most items also need specific tools, which can only be used by a particular role. Agents may (and might have to) cooperatively assemble. In that case, the resources of those agents are combined.

* The __initiating agent__ receives the finished item (if all prerequisites are satisfied).
* Items are preferably taken from the initiating agent.
* If multiple __assistants__ carry the same required item, it is not guranteed which item is consumed.

#### Dumps

Items can be destroyed at __dumps__ (to free capacity). Those items cannot be retrieved.

#### Storage

__Storage__ facilities allow to store items up to a specific volume and also are the target for completing jobs.

The storage has a limited __capacity__ which counts for all teams, i.e. one team can fill a storage while not leaving any space for other teams.

Each team has a separate (unlimited) compartment in each storage. This compartment cannot be filled directly but only as a consequence of other actions:

* If a team delivers items towards job completion, but another team is faster, the partial delivery is moved to this compartment.
* If a team posted a job which another team completed, the items which were required for this job are moved to the posting team's compartment.

#### Resouce nodes

__Resource nodes__ represent natural sources for certain items. Agents can go to the nodes to gather those items, but it always takes a certain number of gather actions until a new resource is found.

When there are multiple agents gathering at the same resource node only one of them will get the resource depending on the order in which they executed their actions.

The location of resource nodes is not common knowledge and agents are only able to perceive the nodes when they are close to them.

### Teams

The scenario can be played with any number of teams simultaneously. Each team contains the same number of agents per __role__.

### Roles

The roles in the scenario can be configured under the top-level `roles` key in the simulation JSON object (which is one element of the `match` array).

```JSON
"roles" : {
  "car" : {
    "speed" : 3,
    "load" : 550,
    "battery" : 500,
    "roads" : ["road"]
  },
  "drone" : {
    "speed" : 5,
    "load" : 100,
    "battery" : 250,
    "roads" : ["air"]
  },
  "motorcycle" : {
    "speed" : 4,
    "load" : 300,
    "battery" : 350,
    "roads" : ["road"]
  },
  "truck" : {
    "speed" : 2,
    "load" : 3000,
    "battery" : 1000,
    "roads" : ["road"]
  }
}
```

Each role has its name as key and the following parameters:

* __speed__: how many 'units' the agent can move in one step
* __load__: how much volume the agent may carry
* __battery__: the agent's battery size
* __roads__: which roads the agent can navigate (currently 'road'  for all roads and 'air' for travelling linear distances between two points)

These 4 roles will also be used in the contest, however, the parameters are still subject to change.

### Job
A job is the general way to earn money in this scenario.

- __begin__: the job begins in this step, i.e. this is the first step where the job
is perceived by all agents
- __end__: the last step in which the job can be completed. At the end of
this step, the job cannot be perceived anymore.
- __reward__: the amount of money that is earned by completing the job
- __storage__: to complete the job, items have to be delivered to this storage

### AuctionJob
An auction job has an initial phase in which agent teams can bid for it.
The teams are bidding the amount of money which they want to be paid for completing
the job. Of course, the team with the lowest bid wins.

This type of job has the advantage, that a team can be sure to be the only one
working on it if it won the auction. However, the teams have to estimate
how low they can bid to still have an advantage.

Each step during the auction phase, the current lowest bid and corresponding team
can be perceived by all agents.

- __begin__: the step in which the auctioning begins.
- __auctionTime__: the duration of the auction phase. The winner of the auction
will be determined at the end of step (begin + auctionTime - 1).
- __end__: the latest step in which items can be delivered to complete the job
- __reward__: for this job, the reward is the maximum reward possible, i.e. bids
that go above this value will be ignored.
- __fine__: at the end of the auction job, if it has not been completed, the
team that won the auction has to pay this fine.

### Mission

A mission is a special type of job that is given out randomly. All teams will receive an instance of the same mission to complete. This mission has to be completed (or the fine paid).

Note: Technically, a mission is an auction that is immediately assigned to each team in the simulation.

## Actions

In each step, an agent may execute _exactly one_ action. The actions are gathered and executed in random order.

All actions have the same probability to just fail randomly.

Some actions may lead to __conflicts__. For example, two agents might want to buy the same item from a shop (and only one of these items is left). In that case, the agent whose action is executed first gets the item, while the action of the other agent is treated as though no item is available (which is actually true).

Each action has a number of `parameters`. The exact number depends on the type of action. Also, the position of each parameter determines its meaning. Parameters are always string values.

## Percepts

Percepts are sent by the server as XML files and contain information about the current simulation. Initital percepts (sent via `SIM-START` messages) contain static information while other percepts (sent via `REQUEST-ACTION` messages) contain information about the current simulation state.

The complete XML format is discussed in [protocol.md](protocol.md).

### Initial percept

This percept contains information that does not change during the whole simulation. As mentioned in the protocol description, everything is contained in a `simulation` element.
A more or less complete example can be found [here](resources/example-simStart.xml).

Example:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<message timestamp="1489763697332" type="sim-start">
  <simulation id="2017-QuickTest-Sim" map="london"
              seedCapital="10" steps="1000" team="A">
    <role battery="500" load="1000" name="SampleRole" speed="10">
      <tool name="tool0"/>
      <tool name="tool1"/>
    </role>
    <item name="item0" volume="72"/>
    <item name="item14" volume="0">
      <item amount="2" name="item12"/>
      <item amount="1" name="item8"/>
      <tool name="tool0"/>
    </item>
  </simulation>
</message>
```

#### Simulation details

The `simulation` tag has attributes for the simulation `id`, the name of the `map` that is used, the seed capital, the number of simulation `steps` to be played and the name of the agent's `team`.

#### Role details

The percept also contains the agent's `role` and its details; speed, maximum load, name and maximum battery charge. The role element may further contain an arbitrary number of child nodes, one for each tool the role is allowed to use.

#### Item details

Each item type present in the simulation has a child node in the simulation element. It contains the item's unique `name` and `volume`.

If the item has to be assembled, the necessary parts are included as child nodes (`item` and `tool` elements) of the item element.

#### Contest note

The roles and their details will be defined (and made public) in before and not change between simulations. This does not hold for tools however, as they are random for all simulations.

### Step percept

This percept contains information about the simulation state at the beginning of each step.
A more or less complete example can be found [here](resources/example-requestAction.xml).

Example:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<message timestamp="1489763697397" type="request-action">
  <percept deadline="1489763701395" id="0">
    <simulation step="0"/>
    <self charge="101" facility="shop1" lat="51.4741" load="0" lon="-0.06057" name="agentA1"
          role="SampleRole" team="A">
      <action result="successful" type="skip"/>
      <items amount="4" name="item0"/>
      <items amount="1" name="tool1"/>
      <route i="0" lat="51.4739" lon="-0.06657"/>
      <route i="1" lat="51.47384" lon="-0.07346"/>
      <route i="2" lat="51.47379" lon="-0.08041"/>
      <route i="3" lat="51.47349" lon="-0.08759"/>
      <route i="4" lat="51.47452" lon="-0.09439"/>
      <route i="5" lat="51.47704" lon="-0.10037"/>
      <route i="6" lat="51.4777" lon="-0.10676"/>
    </self>
    <team money="10"/>

    ...

  </percept>
</message>
```

The information is contained in the `percept` element within the message. This element contains an arbitrary number of child nodes, each representing an element of the simulation.

#### Self details

The `self` element contains information about the agent itself; its current battery charge and used carrying capacity, position, role and team. If the agent is in the same location as a facility, that facility is listed as an attribute as well. The action the agent executed in the last step together with its result is included in a child node of the `self` element.

Also, a child element for each carried item type is nested. Finally, if the agent currently follows a route, each waypoint of that route is listed in a child node, containing its location and index within the route.

#### Team details

The `team` element contains information about the agent's team; currently only how much money it owns.

#### Entity details

For each entity (or agent) in the simulation, one `entity` element is added.

Example:

```XML
<entity lat="51.4659" lon="-0.1035" name="agentB3" role="SampleRole" team="B"/>
```

Each of these elements contains the entity's name, position, role and team.

#### Facility details

For each facility, a specific element is included.

##### Shop details

Example:

```XML
<shop lat="51.4861" lon="-0.1477" name="shop1" restock="3">
  <item amount="8" name="tool7" price="211"/>
  <item amount="10" name="item0" price="217"/>
</shop>
```

For each shop, its name, position and restock value are included. Each shop contains a child node for each item type that can currently be bought, consisting of the item's name, its price and the available quantity.

##### Workshop details

Example:

```XML
<workshop lat="51.4983" lon="-0.0356" name="workshop3"/>
```

##### Charging station details

Example:

```XML
<chargingStation lat="51.5182" lon="-0.0361" name="chargingStation6" rate="88"/>
```

##### Dump details

Example:

```XML
<dump lat="51.5163" lon="-0.1588" name="dump2"/>
```

##### Storage details

Example:

```XML
<storage lat="51.4906" lon="-0.0825" name="storage6" totalCapacity="9277"
         usedCapacity="0">
         <item delivered="3" name="item0" stored="0"/>
</storage>
```

The storage contains a child node for each item type that is stored or delivered (or both) for an agent's team.

##### ResourceNode details

Example:

```XML
<resourceNode lat="51.478" lon="-0.03632" name="resourceNode1" resource="item7"/>
```

The resource node element contains the item that can be mined. Attention: This percept is only visible if the agent is "close" to the node (see `visibilityRange` parameter).

#### Job details

An element for each job is added (`job`, `auction`, `mission` or `posted`).

__Regular job example:__ (all non-auction jobs not posted by the team)

```XML
<job start="59" end="159" id="job0" reward="5018" storage="storage2">
  <required amount="3" name="item0"/>
</job>
```

__Auction job example:__ (all auctions in auction state and active auctions assigned to the team)

```XML
<auction auctionTime="5" start="10" end="100" fine="500" id="job2"
         lowestBid="20" reward="1000" storage="storage0">
  <required amount="777" name="item0"/>
</auction>
```

Please note that the `lowestBid` attribute is not present if no bids have been placed yet.

Assigned auctions can be recognized by comparing `start + auctionTime` with the current step. If the auction is still visible after the `auctionTime`, the team has won the auction.

__Posted job example:__ (all active jobs posted by the team)

```XML
<posted start="30" end="156" id="job11" reward="6546" storage="storage8">
  <required amount="3" name="item0"/>
</posted>
```

__Mission job example:__ (all currently active missions for the team)

```XML
<mission auctionTime="0" start="10" end="100" fine="500" id="job2"
         lowestBid="1000" reward="1001" storage="storage0">
  <required amount="42" name="item1"/>
</mission>
```

The `roles` object has already been discussed in the [Roles](#roles) section, while the `generate` block will be subject of the [Random generation](#random-generation) section.

For each simulation, the following parameters may be specified:

* __id__: a name for the simulation; e.g. used in replays together with the starting time
* __scenarioClass__: the class containing the scenario; needs to be written as above for this scenario
* __steps__: the number of steps the simulation will take
* __map__: the map to use; needs to be in the `server/osm` folder as `XYZ.osm.pbf` file
* __seedCapital__: the amount of money owned by each team at the start of the simulation
* __min/maxLon/Lat__: the map bounds; the declared area must be present in the map file
* __centerLon/Lat__: an internal value used for positioning things and routing; basically, any location of the map is considered reachable if there exists a route between this "center" and that location in both directions
* __proximity__: the proximity value (see [Locations](#locations) section)
* __cellSize__: the cellSize value (see [Locations](#locations) section)
* __randomSeed__: the random seed that is used for map generation and action execution
* __randomFail__: the probability for any action to fail (in %)
* __postJobLimit__: the number of simultaneously active jobs for each team (i.e. a team may not post more jobs)
* __gotoCost__: the energy cost for 1 goto action
* __rechargeRate__: the energy that is restored between 1 and 2 times with 1 recharge action
* __visibilityRange__: the maximum distance in meters between an agent and a resource node for the agent to perceive that resource node

The number of agents per role is defined in the `entities` array. Each object may have only one key (the name of the role). The value for the key is the number of agents for that role.

Agents are assigned their role according to their position in the team config. In the above example, the first two agents would be Car agents, the next two would be Drone agents, etc.

## Random generation

In the first section of the random generation the parameters for the generation of the facilities can be specified:
* __quadSize__: cellSize of the grid that is used for positioning
* Parameters for charging stations:
  * __density__: probability of placing a charging station per quad (or number of charging stations to place if >1)
  * __rateMin/Max__: bounds for charging rate
* Parameters for shops:
  * __density__: see above
  * __min/maxProd__: bounds for number of different available products per shop
  * __amountMin/Max__: bounds for the starting amount a shop sells of a product
  * __priceAddMin/Max__: bounds for the price a shop adds to an items value (can vary between products of the same shop)
  * __restockMin/Max__: bounds for a shop's restock interval
* Parameters for dumps:
  * __density__: see above
* Parameters for workshops:
  * __density__: see above
* Parameters for storage:
  * __density__: see above
  * __capacityMin/Max__: bounds for the storage's capacity
* Parameter for resource nodes:
  * __density__: see above
  * __gatherFrequencyMin/Max__: bounds for number of gather actions after which a new resource is found

In the second section of the random generation the parameters for the generation of the items can be specified:
* __baseItemsMin/Max__: bounds for the number of base items
* __levelDecreaseMin/Max__: bounds for the number of items by which the next level of the item graph will be smaller
* __graphDepthMin/Max__: bounds for the number of levels of the item graph
* __resourcesMin/Max__: bounds for the number of resources
* __min/maxVol__: bounds for the volume of the items
* __valueMin/Max__: bounds for the value of the items
* __min/maxReq__: bounds for the number of required items for assembly
* __reqAmountMin/Max__: bounds for the amount per required item for assembly
* __toolsMin/Max__: bounds for the number of tools
* __toolProbability__: probability of an item needing a tool for assembly

## Commands

A number of commands are handled by this scenario, which may help with debugging or testing your agents.

`print facilities`: prints all facilities to the console

`print items`: prints all items to the console

`give itemX agentY Z`: gives Z units of item "itemX" to an agent "agentY" (if the agent has enough free space)

`store storageX itemY A Z`: stores Z units of item "itemY" for team "A" in storage "storageX" (if the storage has enough free space)

`addJob X Y Z storage0 item0 A item1 B ...`: adds a new job to the system, starting in step X, ending in step Y, with reward Z, target storage "storage0", and requiring A units of "item0", B units of "item1", etc.

`addAuction A B C D E storage0 item0 X item1 Y ...`: similar to `addJob`, A is the start of the job, B the job's end, C the reward, D the auction time and E the auction's fine
